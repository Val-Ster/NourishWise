            <h2>What is the Mediterranean Diet?</h2>
            <p>
              The Mediterranean diet is inspired by the traditional eating
              habits of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, such as
              Greece, Italy, and Spain. This diet emphasizes whole foods like
              vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean
              proteins, especially fish. Known for its health benefits, the
              Mediterranean diet is as delicious as it is nutritious, offering a
              balanced approach that supports heart health and longevity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2 id="benefits">The Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet</h2>
            <p>
              The Mediterranean diet is praised for its heart-health benefits,
              with studies linking it to reduced risks of cardiovascular
              diseases, diabetes, and stroke. The diet is rich in healthy fats
              from olive oil, omega-3 fatty acids from fish, and a wealth of
              antioxidants from fresh vegetables and fruits. These nutrients
              collectively work to improve cholesterol levels, reduce
              inflammation, and support brain health, making it one of the most
              beneficial diets for long-term well-being.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Furthermore, its high fiber content aids digestion and promotes
              satiety, helping maintain a healthy weight. The diet also
              encourages mindful eating, with an emphasis on enjoying meals with
              family and friends, which contributes to overall happiness and a
              balanced lifestyle.

          <h2 id="how-it-works">How Does the Mediterranean Diet Work?</h2>
          <img
            src="assets/mediterranean-pyramid.jpg"
            alt="Mediterranean food pyramid illustration"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            The Mediterranean diet follows a simple principle: focus on whole,
            plant-based foods and healthy fats while limiting processed foods,
            red meats, and refined sugars. Meals are built around vegetables,
            fruits, grains, legumes, and fish, with small amounts of dairy,
            poultry, and meat enjoyed occasionally. Olive oil is the primary
            source of added fat, enhancing flavor while offering
            heart-protective monounsaturated fats.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Meal structure varies based on personal preference and availability,
            but the diet encourages enjoying food slowly and with others,
            promoting both physical and social well-being.

            Ready to dive into the Mediterranean lifestyle? Here are some tips
            to get started:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <br />
            <li>
              1. <strong>Fill Your Plate with Vegetables:</strong> Aim to
              include a variety of colorful vegetables with every meal for
              optimal nutrition.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              2. <strong>Choose Healthy Fats:</strong> Incorporate olive oil as
              your main fat source, and add nuts, seeds, and avocados for
              additional healthy fats.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              3. <strong>Eat More Fish:</strong> Include fish in your meals
              twice a week, especially fatty fish like salmon, which are rich in
              omega-3s.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              4. <strong>Limit Red Meat:</strong> Save red meat for special
              occasions and focus on lean proteins like poultry and legumes
              instead.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              5. <strong>Savor Every Bite:</strong> Embrace the Mediterranean
              approach by enjoying meals slowly and mindfully, preferably with
              family or friends.
            </li>
          </ul>
