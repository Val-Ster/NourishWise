            <h2>Understanding the DASH Diet</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the world of the DASH diet—a vibrant, delicious
              approach to eating that not only tantalizes your taste buds but
              also promotes heart health and overall well-being. Whether you're
              looking to lower your blood pressure, improve your nutrition, or
              just want to eat better, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
              Hypertension) has you covered. So, grab a snack (preferably
              healthy!) and let’s dive in!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>What is the DASH Diet?</h2>
            <p>
              At its core, the DASH diet emphasizes wholesome, nutrient-rich
              foods that can help you reduce your sodium intake and manage
              hypertension (high blood pressure). Developed by the National
              Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the DASH diet isn't just
              about cutting back on salt—it's a lifestyle change that focuses on
              eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
              lean proteins, and healthy fats.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Think of the DASH diet as a colorful plate filled with a variety
              of foods. It’s not about deprivation; instead, it’s all about
              making healthier choices that you can enjoy. The idea is to
              nourish your body while also satisfying your cravings. Sounds
              good, right?
            </p>

          <h2 id="How">How Does the DASH Diet Work?</h2>
          <img src="assets/dash-pyramid.jpg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            The DASH diet works by promoting foods that are naturally low in
            sodium and high in potassium, calcium, and magnesium—all essential
            nutrients for heart health. By incorporating more fruits,
            vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy into your meals, you can
            naturally lower your blood pressure and improve your cardiovascular
            health.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The magic of the DASH diet lies in its flexibility. You can
            customize it to fit your personal preferences, making it easier to
            stick to in the long run. Plus, it encourages a variety of flavors
            and textures, so you’ll never feel bored with your meals!

          <br />
          <p>
            Starting the DASH diet doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Here’s a
            simple guide to help you ease into this healthier lifestyle:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <br />
            <li>
              1. <strong>Set Your Goals:</strong> Determine what you want to
              achieve with the DASH diet—whether it’s lowering blood pressure,
              losing weight, or simply eating healthier.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              2. <strong>Plan Your Meals:</strong> Start by creating a meal plan
              for the week. Include a variety of foods from different food
              groups to keep your meals exciting.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              3. <strong>Grocery Shopping:</strong> Stock up on DASH-friendly
              foods. Make a list to avoid impulse buys that can derail your
              healthy eating habits
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              4. <strong>Prep Your Meals:</strong> Meal prep can save you time
              during busy weekdays. Chop veggies, cook grains, and prepare
              snacks in advance so you have healthy options ready to go.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              5. <strong>Mindful Eating:</strong>Pay attention to portion sizes
              and savor each bite. Mindful eating can help you enjoy your food
              and recognize when you're full.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              6. <strong>Track your journey:</strong> This is where NourishWise
              comes in, make sure to log in your daily meals and calorie intake
              as often as possible. Tracking your progression, or even
              regression, helps to not only keep you motivated and accountable,
              but helps you notice any missteps to be able to solve them early.
            </li>
