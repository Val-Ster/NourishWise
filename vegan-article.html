            <h2>What is the Vegan Diet?</h2>
            <p>
              The vegan diet is a popular plant-based eating lifestyle that
              excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs.
              This diet focuses on consuming fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts,
              and seeds, making it ideal for individuals looking to adopt a
              health-conscious and environmentally friendly lifestyle. Whether
              for ethical, environmental, or health reasons, veganism has gained
              global appeal as a sustainable diet choice. Let's dive into what
              makes this diet unique and beneficial.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h2 id="benefits">The Benefits of a Vegan Diet</h2>
            <p>
              A vegan diet is rich in essential nutrients, such as fiber,
              vitamins C and E, and antioxidants, all of which support overall
              health and vitality. Studies show that vegans tend to have a lower
              risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers due to the
              reduced intake of saturated fats and processed foods.
              Additionally, the plant-based nature of the diet supports better
              digestion, improved skin health, and a lower carbon footprint,
              making it a win for both personal health and the environment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Since vegan diets focus on whole, unprocessed foods, they can be
              an effective way to maintain a healthy weight while feeling full
              and energized. Furthermore, this diet encourages creativity in the
              kitchen, with a variety of plant-based foods and recipes that are
              both satisfying and nutrient-dense.

          <h2 id="how-it-works">How Does the Vegan Diet Work?</h2>
          <img src="assets/vegan-1.jpg" alt="Vegan food pyramid illustration" />
          <br />
          <p>
            The vegan diet centers around whole plant foods. Vegans typically
            base their meals on vegetables, legumes, grains, and protein-rich
            plant sources like tofu and lentils. Plant-based alternatives, such
            as almond or soy milk, provide options for traditional dairy
            products. Unlike many diets, veganism is more a lifestyle choice,
            focusing on ethical, environmental, and health benefits associated
            with reducing animal products.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Vegans also avoid all animal-derived ingredients, like honey or
            gelatin. As a result, the diet relies on a variety of fruits,
            vegetables, and legumes, making it both diverse and adaptable for
            personal preferences and seasonal produce availability.
