            <h2>What is the Fruitarian Diet?</h2>
            <p>
              The fruitarian diet is a fascinating and unique approach to eating
              that centers around the consumption of fruits, often making up
              50-75% of one's daily intake. This vibrant diet appeals to those
              who love fresh, sweet flavors and are looking for a minimalist,
              plant-based approach. In addition to fruits, some fruitarians
              include nuts, seeds, and minimal vegetables, though preferences
              can vary widely. Curious if this diet could be a match for you?
              Let's explore!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2 id="benefits">The Benefits of a Fruitarian Diet</h2>
            <p>
              The fruitarian diet is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and essential
              vitamins, making it beneficial for those aiming to enhance their
              nutrient intake. Fruits like berries, citrus, and tropical fruits
              are known for their high levels of vitamins C and A, potassium,
              and other micronutrients that support immune health, skin
              vibrancy, and digestive wellness. Additionally, the diet’s high
              fiber content can aid digestion and help maintain a healthy
              weight.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Since fruit is naturally low in calories and free from processed
              sugars, the diet can be a way to reduce calorie intake while still
              feeling satisfied. Furthermore, it emphasizes whole foods,
              encourages hydration, and can even help cultivate mindfulness
              around eating choices. For many, this diet offers a path to
              simplicity, relying primarily on nature’s sweetness.

          <h2 id="how-it-works">How Does the Fruitarian Diet Work?</h2>
          <img
            src="assets/fruitarian-pyramid.jpg"
            alt="Fruitarian food pyramid illustration"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            The fruitarian diet follows a straightforward principle: prioritize
            raw fruits as the bulk of each meal. While there are no strict
            rules, most fruitarians consume fruits as their main energy source
            and may add nuts, seeds, and occasional raw vegetables. Eating
            primarily raw and unprocessed foods is key, allowing for maximum
            nutrient retention and simplicity. Some follow a more regimented
            structure, while others incorporate flexibility with foods such as
            avocados, cucumbers, and tomatoes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Many fruitarians approach eating intuitively, listening to their
            bodies to decide which fruits and how much to eat. This diet's
            structure allows for a customized approach, letting individuals
            choose fruits that fit their seasonal preferences and regional
            availability.
