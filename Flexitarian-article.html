            <h2>Understanding the Flexitarian Diet</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the world of the Flexitarian diet—a deliciously
              flexible way to eat that lets you savor plant-based foods while
              still enjoying your favorite meats! If you're looking to improve
              your health without completely cutting out your beloved burgers
              and bacon, the Flexitarian diet is just for you. Let’s dive in and
              explore how you can enjoy a healthier lifestyle while indulging in
              a variety of delicious meals!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>What is the Flexitarian Diet?</h2>
            <p>
              The Flexitarian diet is all about flexibility, making it easier to
              embrace a predominantly plant-based diet while still allowing for
              the occasional meat dish. It’s a blend of the words "flexible" and
              "vegetarian," reflecting its core philosophy: eat mostly plants,
              but don’t stress about it. The Flexitarian diet encourages you to
              focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods while also providing the
              freedom to enjoy meat in moderation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Think of it as a way to dip your toes into the world of
              vegetarianism without diving in headfirst. You can experiment with
              new flavors and textures while still enjoying the comfort of your
              favorite meals. Sounds liberating, right?

          <h2 id="How">How Does the Flexitarian Diet Work?</h2>
          <img src="assets/flax-pyramid.jpg" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            The Flexitarian diet works by encouraging you to prioritize
            plant-based foods—think fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and
            seeds—while allowing for moderate amounts of meat, fish, and dairy.
            This approach helps reduce your overall meat consumption while
            boosting your intake of essential nutrients and fiber.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the best aspects of the Flexitarian diet is its adaptability.
            You can customize it to suit your taste preferences, dietary
            restrictions, and lifestyle, making it easy to follow and
            sustainable in the long run. The goal is to nourish your body while
            still enjoying food. After all, food should be a source of joy, not
            stress!

            <li>
              1. <strong>Set Your Intentions:</strong> Decide why you want to
              adopt the Flexitarian diet—whether it’s to improve health, lose
              weight, or explore new foods.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              2. <strong>Plan Your Meals:</strong> Create a weekly meal plan
              focused on plant-based dishes. Include some of your favorite
              meat-based meals to ease the transition.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>

            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              5. <strong>Mindful Eating:</strong> Enjoy each bite and pay
              attention to how different foods make you feel. Savor the flavors
              of plant-based dishes!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              6. <strong>Track Your Progress:</strong> Log your daily meals here
              on NourishWise. Keeping track of what you eat can help you stay
